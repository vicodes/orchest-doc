# Considerations

:::tip[Note]

This below considerations are for D.O.T teams who wants to use the D.O.T's own hosted deployment

:::

## Below are some points to keep in consideration before using the platform

- Take all the AWS resources access to your service IAM role
    - Engine MSK access
        - Non-Prod: `orchest-non-prod`
        - Prod: `Orchest-prod`
    - Engine KMS access (For encryption and decryption)
        - Non-Prod: `arn:aws:kms:eu-central-1:274765082782:key/78dfe576-b7d9-4e53-8d8e-d3ac07611bae`
        - Prod: `arn:aws:kms:eu-central-1:616018632173:key/480b936b-3d0e-4670-8331-c425906dc4fb`

### Important Points:
- You have to deploy your service first to deploy BPMN chart on Cluster, else chart deployment fails.
- If any worker is not present in the service, and it is in BPMN, you cannot deploy the chart.
